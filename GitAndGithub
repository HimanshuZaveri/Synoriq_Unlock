{
    Topics - 1> What is GIT
             2> What is Github
             3> Relation
             4> Basic Workflow

    1> GIT => -- Version Control system
              -- Free and Open Source
              -- Collabration
              -- Track Changes
    Types=>      1. Cetralized VCS      =>  Common Repository and Continuously needed to be online
                 2. Distributed VCS  {Git}       => Has a copy at the local machine on which work is done and then later it is commit -> push to the server repository

    2> Github => -- Website to upload your repositories online
                 -- provides backup 
                 -- provides GUIto repositories
                 -- makes collabration easier

    3> Git is not related to github.....
        ||                         \\
        version control              Website
        system and can                 < can use github with any VCS>
        be used
        <Similarly we can use 
        git with any online repository 
        management system>


    4> Workflow of git
        =>  Remote Repo. => {Clone/Pull} -- Local Repo  --  => From local machine we can take or chekout any repository or branch and create a working copy of it
        =>  We can make any to this working copy and it can be done while we our offline 
        =>  Once changes are done we can execute add command and it will put these changes in staging area 
        =>  Until this stage the changes are not committed yet i.e changes not saved to local repository -- For the same we execute commit command
        =>  Push command will finally apply the changes to the remote repository....

                   git add  - after making changes in file we first need to add ... and only then we commit
                   git commit -m "<Message>"
    4> Adding to remote repo=>        git remote add origin <online repository location>
                                      git push
