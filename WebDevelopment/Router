	specify path u want in url
	and then pass the component in the route tags which has to be loaded for the given url
	
Link --> Attribute "to"
	used in place of anchor(<a>) tag;
	the text specified within these rags will take us to the specified path in the "to" attribute
	
NavLink --> Attribute 'activeClassName'	 and   'to'
	to -> It has similar functionality as that in link 
	activeClassName -> this attribute makes NavLink different from Link
	In this we specify css class which will be active on the text in the tags when this link is active
	
Switch -->
	This tag makes sure only one Route or to be specific 
	only things in one route is active at a time on changing the url

Redirect --> Attribute 'to'

	As the tag says, it helps to redirect to different (specified in the "to" attribute)
	url for the execution of this tag
